Weak symbols work only if:

1. The module containing the symbol(s) is opened first.
2. And it's dlopened with RTLD_GLOBAL

Dynamic list works _regardless_ of RTLD_GLOBAL/LOCAL

We might get away with 2, but not with 1 :'(

Currently we've defined an interface (ABI only?), which is _very_ likely to crash cause problems.
I.e. change anything in the driver, and use "missmatched" dri vs vdpau - BOOOOM.

Alternative solutions:
 - Copy X/Y from DRI to vdpau and/or back, bu SYNC comes into play:
   - Hope no-one wants them in sync ?
   - Maarten's WW work ?
   - Other way to syncing them ?
   - Performance impact might be significant, or at least noticable.
 - Rework things - libdrm/kernel level, so that one can
   - Redo the ctx (and everything that we've already drawn) is the interop happens
   - 
 - Check what the blob does :-) Here is some guesswork
   - Same thing as us - exposes ABI/API between GL and VDPAU
   - Greates a separate GL thread (yet same ctx?) for VDPAU, and uses some mangling ?
   - Does not create any GL thread and no ctx. Hmm I might need some sleep this sounds stupid.
 

Quick "fix":
 - Add a version check and bail out. Version check ? More like a sha one, _regardless_ if we're doing release/debug/from git/from tarball or not build.
